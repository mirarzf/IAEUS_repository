# Segmentation for IAEUS

## UNet implementation 

The UNet implementation here is based on the source code found at [this repository of a Pytorch implementation](https://github.com/LeeJunHyun/Image_Segmentation). 
The files `train.py`, `evaluate.py`, `test.py` and `predict.py` all use UNet. As their names suggest, they are respectively used to train, evaluate (during training), test the model and do a prediction if given a test dataset.
